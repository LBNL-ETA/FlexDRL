raw_model: original model developed by Baptiste

OTHEQ_*_*

  Descrption:
  - HVAC is controlled by adjusting the heat input to room, through changing the 
    schedule of other equipment. 
  - For model settings, see Section 7.1 in 
    https://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/fmu/EnergyPlus/export/userGuide

  Input:
  - heat input to the room

  Output:
  - room temp

HVAC_*_*

  Descrption:
  - HVAC is controlled by adjusting supply air temp and flow rate, hot/chilled water temp. 

  Input:
  - supply air temp
  - supply air flow rate
  - hot water supply temp
  - chilled water supply temp

  Output:
  - room temp
      
sha_*_*

  Descrption:
  - Interior shading is controlled: 1 for shading is on, cover the window;
                                    0 for shading is off, not cover the window; 
  - The shading is controlled by: 1. adding a shading schedule (FMU_SHADING_ZONEA), which is input from csv or FMU
				  2. adding a shading material (ROLL SHADE) to (WindowMaterial:Shade)
                                  3. using (FMU_SHADING_ZONEA) to define (shadingControl_ZONEA) an object of
                                     (WINDOWPROPERTY:SHADINGCONTROL)
                                  4. using (shadingControl_ZONEA) to define a field (Shading Control Name) of the 
	                             window (Win-FlexLab-X3-ZoneA), an object of (FenestrationSurface:Detailed)
 
  Input:
  - heat input to the room

  Output:
  - room temp

*_csv_*: used to test model, input is from csv file
