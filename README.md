# FlexDRL

## Setup and Execution

1. Pull the docker image: ``docker pull stouzani/drl_flexlab_v6:1``
2. if you are using mac use the original makefile; if you are using ubuntu then replace in the makefile `` -e DISPLAY=docker.for.mac.host.internal:0`` by `` -e DISPLAY=${DISPLAY} ``
3. Run the docker container: ``make run``
4. Run scripts:
    * test a simple control: ``python simulation/simulate.py``
    * test/run DRL training: ``python simulation/rl_train_ddpg.py``
    * test/run DRL prediction: ``python simulation/rl_predict_ddpg.py``
